The test application `test_dsig_digestvalue' needs the PKCS#12 
container as distributed by the fiscal authorities to be available
as TestHersteller_ELSTEstR.pfx (original filename) from the data/
directory.  According to the README file, the .pfx file must
not be shared to end users, therefore it's not contained in the
CVS repository.
