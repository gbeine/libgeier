.SH NAME
geier \- Command line interface to the Geier library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B geier
[\fIOPTION\fR...] [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Command line interface to the Geier library (libgeier), allowing to
validate, apply stylesheets, digitally sign and send Elster XML
documents.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Don't send the Elster XML document to the inland revenue office for
further processing.  This is, if you want to just check the document for
validity (against the schema files), apply the corresponding stylesheet,
etc. supply this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Write the result which we have received from the inland revenue office
to the file FILE (right after decryption).  This might be useful, if you
want to keep a copy of the result somewhere and provided the
\fB\-\-xsltify\fR command line argument.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-encrypt\-only\fR
Only encrypt the provided Elster XML document.  Nothing more.  This is
mainly for testing purposes, as you will not be able to decrypt the
document (since it is public key encrypted).  If you transfer the result
manually, you will not be able to decrypt the result either, since it is
encrypted symetrically and you do not get the needed key back.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-softpse\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Digitally sign the document using software certificates. The file with
the provided name is expected to contain a PKCS#12 certificate container
from which the private key as well as the certificate needed for signing
will be extracted.  If you supply this option, you will be asked to
enter the container's PIN code later on.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-validate\fR
Try to validate the document against the schema files, provided by
Germany's inland revenue office, right after parsing.  In case the
document cannot be validated, complain and abort before any further
processing.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-xsltify\fR
Apply the stylesheet, suitable for this type of Elster XML document, to
the document itself in order to generate XHTML output.  In case you have
chosen to send the document to the inland revenue office, the result we
got back will be mangled.  If you have provided the \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
switch, the stylesheet will be applied against the provided document
itself.
.br
You most probably want to use this option, if you would like to have a
somewhat printable protocol after transmitting your data.
.TP
\-?, \fB\-\-help\fR
Give this help list.
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Give a short usage message.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print program version.
.PP
Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.
.PP
Please mind that libgeier is currently very much in alpha alike state,
therefore please do not expect a tool working perfectly right now.
