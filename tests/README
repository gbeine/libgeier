Hi,

in order to run the test-suite, simply run `make check' from this
directory.  Please mind that some of the tests are using the Perl
module, therefore you need to have it installed or at least compiled
and integrated into your environment.

All the tests should actually pass, send a mail to either
taxbird@taxbird.de or stesie@brokenpipe.de if one of them fails
repeadetly. 

Please mind that test_send_text might take some time to complete since
it tries to establish a connection to the fiscal authorities clearing
host.  Furthermore the test may fail, if this connection cannot be
established for whatever reason (maybe you not connected to the
internet).
