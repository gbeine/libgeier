    <title>GEIER Overview</title>
    <para>
      GEIER is the first free library to encrypt, digitally sign, decrypt,
      validate and send gathered tax declarations data to the
      German inland revenue offices.

      Furthermore it allows to generate XHTML transmission protocols using
      XSLT mechanisms.
    </para>

    <para>
      GEIER is short for <emphasis>GPL'd Elster Interface</emphasis> and
      part of the Taxbird project.
    </para>

    <para>
      GEIER uses the COALA interface supplied by the German inland revenue
      offices.  COALA is a publicly documented transmission interface,
      which heavily relies on XML.  The data is transmitted compressed with
      GZIP and symmetrically encrypted with a 3DES key.  The 3DES key, which
      is generated by the GEIER library, is sent to the Elster servers 
      after it has been asymmetrically encrypted using the RSA algorithm.
      For the actual transmission HTTP/Post is utilized.
    </para>

    <para>
      Besides plain transmission GEIER is capable of digitally signing the
      Elster XML-documents using software certificates (X.509 based).
      The latter approach is called <emphasis>Elster Basis</emphasis> by
      the fiscal authorities.
    </para>

    <para>
      Please mind, that GEIER heavily relies on Mozilla (xulrunner) NSS.
